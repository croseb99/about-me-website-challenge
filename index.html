            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Caroline Bost and I'm 24 years old. I was born in Chicago Illinois but moved and lived in Nashville TN and Birmingham AL, until I moved back to Tennessee two years 
                ago and currently live in Chattanooga! I am the youngest of my family and have one dog named Lacey. Some hobbies I enjoy are painting, reading and playing video games with friends! I attended 
                Mississippi State University for a bit before deciding to drop out and work until I figured out what I wanted to pursue with my life. During that time, I worked as a manager at a restaurant 
                for about five years, then worked at an animal clinic for a short period of time until I then began working as a nanny for the past few years! I love working with kids, as I can't wait to be 
                a mom one day, but I realized I'll never know what my future with coding would hold unless I take the chance and find out. I've always been interested and like programming and coding of all 
                sorts ever since I played a Java Script coded game in middle school, but never truly got into it until I completed a few programs with CodeCademy and some friends of mine and I messed around 
                with different code plugins for a game called Minecraft. I think it's awesome how many things you can create with the world of coding and I look forward to learning and creating things on my own!

            <h2>Why Choose Career In Coding?</h2>
            <p>What got me into coding and programming you may ask? Well, as someone who has always wanted to be a painter or author, I never took my interest in coding too seriously. However, ever since I 
                played a JavaScript coded game when I was in middle school, the enjoyment I had never left me. I always found coding to be very interesting with how many different things you could create with it. 
                After learning you could create games, phone applications, websites etc. I was amazed but also thought, maybe I was in over my head with wanting to pursue it as a career. Throughout my teenaged 
                years and still even now, I have enjoyed watching content creators who make coding content! I loved watching them modify their current video games with custom modifiers or even create their own 
                video games from scratch! It was content like this that also stuck with me and kept my interest in programming alive. As I got older, went off to college for a bit before leaving, I was having 
                trouble finding what I wanted to do career wise. Still, throughout that journey, that nagging thought of coding never left the back of my mind. After trying out several different jobs that didnt 
                satisfy me in the end, I decided to look more into how I could pursue a career in coding. Then that's when I found CodeCademy! After completing a few different courses, I decided I wanted to take 
                a further step in making this career choice truly happen for me. Then, after looking at several different college programs, that's when I finally landed at Vanderbilt Universitys Coding Bootcamp! 
                I can confidently say I am truly excited for my future in pursuing a career that I genuinely enjoy and can't wait to see what the future holds!
